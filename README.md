As for the website layout, I used bootstrap for creating the main layout, by copy and paste links refer to both css and javascript, which includes grid section, components like card, carousel, forms, Navbar, buttons, with captions slideshow; Content like typography, images, figures to create image. I studied the usage of bootstrap via Youtube and Lynda courses. Through the courses, I learned how to generated different function by adding different class name, and how to reset the css property by adding !important. At the first time, I copy the code directly from bootstrap. When I tried to rewrite the css part, the long and complicated class name made it hard to target. I put it straight by creating my own div with a proper class name first and paste the code inside the div. The main challenge for creating the website was the Portfolio section. I added css animation for the preview to the digital work, and added icon links pointing a larger preview model using bootstrap components Modal. I created six div at the end of html page to refer to six different Modal. As the deeper learning of JavaScript, next project I'll try to create the modal using Javascript to avoid the long HTML work. The another challenge is to obtain the video into components like cards. Hope I can use it successfully in the next assignment. 
Otherwise, the section code of experience is using the template from OnePageLove website template called startbootstrap-agency-gh-pages. I reset the css property to match my whole design of colour and add the download my resume links at the end of this part.
